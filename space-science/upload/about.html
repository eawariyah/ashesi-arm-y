            <h2>
              Welcome to the official website of the Arm Student Club at Ashesi
              University!
            </h2>
            <p>
              Established in 2022, our clubs has a unique role: to foster a
              vibrant community of students from diverse disciplines who share a
              common passion for technology and innovation. We are proud to be
              affiliated with the larger Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
              organization, which is renowned for its cutting-edge technology
              solutions. Our club operates as a feature of the newly established
              (E³)NGAGE labs in Ghana, a part of ARM's initiative to expand its
              African presence.

            <h2>What we do?</h2>
            <p>
              Our club is dedicated to making ARM processors and designs more
              accessible to everyone. We strive to bridge the gap between the
              often thought of difficult to understand and too far to reach ARM
              processors and designs to the basic level. Our goal is to help
              students understand the fundamentals and come up with experimental
              designs that increase the growth of ARM-based user groups,
              developer networks, and boost interest and education to help bring
              about innovation and designs of the future which would benefit us
              all. We provide our members with hands-on experience, *access to
              cutting-edge Arm-based microcontrollers [both theoretically and
              physically], and opportunities to collaborate on projects. By
              doing so, we hope to inspire the next generation of innovators and
              contribute to the growth of the ARM ecosystem
            </p>

              We offer our members the chance to participate in the Embedded
              Learning Challenge, an initiative that enables engineers to gain
              hands-on experience with Arm-based microcontrollers (MCUs) and
              collaborate with like-minded enthusiasts on Arm-based projects and
              learning curriculum from Arm Education online-sales-marketing.com.

              work closely with key Arm technology partners, such as Oracle,
              Google, and AWS, to support the growth of technology in Africa.
              Our partnerships with these industry leaders enable us to attract
              open-source developers, researchers, and industry partners to run
              their compute workloads on Arm and contribute to the Arm ecosystem

              Arm Education initiatives into K-12 schools and universities in
              Ghana online-sales-marketing.com. Community Engagement: We work
              closely with organizations such as Makerspace Ghana and the
              Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to support
              technology-driven learning and skills development, particularly in

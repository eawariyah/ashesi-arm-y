            <h2>
              Welcome to the official website of the Arm Student Club at Ashesi
              University!
            </h2>
            <p>
              Established in 2022, our clubs has a unique role: to foster a
              community of students from diverse disciplines who share a common
              passion for technology and innovation. We are proud to be
              affiliated with the larger Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
              organization, which is renowned for its cutting-edge technology
              solutions. Our club operates as a feature of the newly established
              (E³)NGAGE labs in Ghana, a part of ARM's initiative to expand its
              African presence.

            <h2>What we do?</h2>
            <p>
              Our club is dedicated to making ARM processors and designs more
              accessible to everyone. We strive to bridge the gap between the
              often thought of difficult to understand and too far to reach ARM
              processors and designs to the basic level. Our goal is to help
              students understand the fundamentals and come up with experimental
              designs that increase the growth of ARM-based user groups,
              developer networks, and boost interest and education to help bring
              about innovation and designs of the future which would benefit us
              all. We provide our members with hands-on experience, *access to
              cutting-edge Arm-based microcontrollers [both theoretically and
              physically], and opportunities to collaborate on projects. By
              doing so, we hope to inspire the next generation of innovators and
              contribute to the growth of the ARM ecosystem
            </p>

              <b style="color: #e8b407"> • Embedded Learning Challenges:</b>
              We provide opportunities for our members to learn the
              fundamentals, take part in various embedded learning challenges,
              and participate in a programme that enables students to work
              together on Arm-based projects and gain practical experience with
              Arm-based microcontrollers (MCUs) and Field Programmable Gate
              Arrays (FPGA's).

                • Aritficial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Machine Learning
                including TinyML:
              </b>
              We support the application and growth of AI, machine learning, and
              importantly TinyML in a dynamic environment, realising their
              enormous potential in a variety of uses and applications. By
              utilising the thriving TinyML ecosystem, we provide our members
              with cooperative training programmes and a wealth of knowledge
              resources. Through these initiatives, we help our members fully
              realise TinyML's transformative potential, giving them the tools
              they need to come up with original ideas and have a positive
              influence on the rapidly evolving AI and machine learning
              industries.

              <b style="color: #e8b407"> • Internet of things (IOT): </b>
              In addition to our focus on ARM processors and designs, our club
              also recognizes the significant impact of the Internet of Things
              (IoT). We believe that IoT has the power to revolutionize the way
              we interact with technology and the world around us. Within the
              realm of IoT, our club engages in various activities and
              initiatives to promote understanding and innovation. We provide
              our members with resources and guidance to explore the vast
              possibilities of IoT and its integration with ARM-based systems.
              Through hands-on experiences and theoretical knowledge, we aim to
              empower students to create and implement IoT solutions that
              enhance user experiences, streamline processes, and drive
              technological advancements. By emphasizing the importance of IoT,
              we enable our members to gain insights into the interconnectedness
              of devices, sensors, and networks. We encourage them to explore
              the potential of IoT in areas such as smart homes, industrial
              automation, healthcare, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
              Through collaborative projects and experiential learning, we
              foster a community of IoT enthusiasts who actively contribute to
              the growth and development of this transformative technology.
              Moreover, our club recognizes the significance of security and
              privacy considerations in the IoT landscape. We emphasize the
              importance of implementing robust security measures and ethical
              practices to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of IoT
              systems. By addressing these concerns, we strive to create a
              foundation for responsible and sustainable IoT deployments.

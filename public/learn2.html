              <h1>About the Course</h1>
              <p>
                Embedded systems are the fundamental building blocks of our
                connected world, and Arm-based devices are the industry
                standard. This course will provide you with the practical skills
                and confidence to build your own embedded system using the
                popular and affordable ST Nucleo F401RE development board.
                Connected home appliances, biomedical devices, autonomous
                vehicles, and IoT applications all rely on real-time operating
                systems (RTOS) to manage multiple digital and analog inputs, and
                efficient communication protocols to handle the transfer of data
                between peripherals and a microcontroller. By enrolling in
                Embedded Systems Essentials with Arm: Get Practical with
                Hardware, you will discover why these are powerful tools for any
                aspiring Embedded Systems designer.

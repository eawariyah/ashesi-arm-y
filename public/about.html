            <h2>
              Welcome to the official website of the Arm-y Student Club at
              Ashesi University!
            </h2>
            <p>
              Established in 2022, our clubs has a unique role: to foster a
              community of students from diverse disciplines who share a common
              passion for technology and innovation. We are proud to be
              affiliated with the larger Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
              organization, which is renowned for its cutting-edge technology
              solutions. Our club operates as a feature of the newly established
              (E³)NGAGE labs in Ghana, a part of ARM's initiative to expand its
              African presence.

            <h2>What we do?</h2>
            <p>
              Our club is dedicated to making ARM processors and designs
              accessible to everyone. We strive to close the gap between the
              commonly perceived complex ARM processors and designs to the basic
              level. Our goal is to help students understand the fundamentals
              and come up with experimental designs that increase the growth of
              ARM-based user groups, develop networks, and boost interest and
              education to help bring about innovation and designs of the future
              which would benefit us all. We provide our members with hands-on
              experience, that is, access to cutting-edge Arm-based
              microcontrollers, and opportunities to collaborate on projects. By
              doing so, we hope to inspire the next generation of innovators and
              contribute to the growth of the ARM ecosystem.

              <b style="color: #e8b407"> • Embedded Learning Challenges:</b>
              We provide opportunities for our members to learn the
              fundamentals, take part in various embedded learning challenges,
              and participate in a programmes that enable students to work
              together on Arm-based projects and gain practical experience with
              Arm-based microcontrollers (MCUs) and Field Programmable Gate
              Arrays (FPGA's).

                including TinyML:
              </b>
              We support the application and growth of AI, machine learning, and
              importantly TinyML in a dynamic environment, realising their
              enormous potential in a variety of uses and applications. By
              utilising the thriving TinyML ecosystem, we provide our members
              with cooperative training programmes and a wealth of knowledge
              resources. Through these initiatives, we help our members fully
              realise TinyML's transformative potential, giving them the tools
              they need to come up with original ideas and have a positive
              influence on the rapidly evolving AI and machine learning
              industries.

              Aside from our club's focus on ARM processors and designs, while
              also acknowledging the transformative potential of the Internet of
              Things (IoT). Through various activities and initiatives, we
              empower members to explore IoT's integration with ARM-based
              systems. We aim to create and implement IoT solutions that enhance
              user experiences, streamline processes, and drive technological
              advancements. By emphasizing the interconnectedness of devices and
              networks, we encourage exploration in areas like smart homes,
              industrial automation, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.
              With a focus on security and privacy, we promote robust measures
              and ethical practices for responsible IoT deployments.

              <h1>The Big Day</h1>
              <span>FEBRUARY 4, 2023</span>
              <p>
                Arm (E³)NGAGE is putting together a vibrant ecosystem in Ghana
                and Africa, and the Ashesi ARM-y on the Hill is glad to be a
                part of it. On the 4th of February 2023, the club was privileged
                to attend the ARM (E³)NGAGE Ecosystem Meetup hosted at the
                British Council, Accra.
              </p>

            Host"
              />
              <p>
                For our first meet-up since the club's launch last semester,
                this was a fantastic experience. The event presented an
                opportunity for club members and leaders to network and interact
                with students of fellow clubs under the (E³)NGAGE banner. It was
                an insightful event that allowed attendees to learn about the
                different systems and approaches through which each club plans
                to achieve the goals of Arm global community strategy, which
                also included the Lab Network approach.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the beginning of the event, students were introduced to Arm,
                TinyML, AI for Good Edge Impulse through a series of videos.
                Subsequently, presentations were made by Arm Student Clubs
                (ARM-y) from some of the attending schools, including Ashesi
                University, University of Ghana, Legon, Valley View University,
                Accra Technical University, Kwame Nkrumah University and
                Academic City.

              />
              <p>
                One key session held was the conversation hosted by Ms. Amanfo
                with Ms. Ruth O., a final year Computer Engineering major from
                the University of Ghana, as the guest. During this session, Ruth
                shared her experience with Arm technology. She focused on her
                journey starting Embedded Systems using Arduino. She further
                explained to students how she took the Arduino Certification
                Exam and obtained the Arduino Starter Kit to work on amazing
                projects.
              </p>

              Host"
              />
              <p>
                It is encouraging to note that there is a community of people
                willing to support individuals interested in contributing to the
                world using embedded technology. MakersPlace, ARM’s local
                partner an avid supporter of this idea, was present to encourage
                and expose students to the world of embedded technology. The
                Ashesi Chapter of the ARM-y greatly appreciates this initiative.
              </p>

              />
              <p>
                Overall, the (E³)NGAGE Ecosystem Meetup was a huge success. The
                ARM-y cannot wait for the next meetup to learn more about each
                Arm community initiatives across the continent and expand the
                ARM-y within the Ghana and African Ecosystem.
